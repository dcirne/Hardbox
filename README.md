Hardbox
=======

This is a HARDware sandBOX for playing with Bluetooth LE.

I am using RedBearLab's Bluetooth Shield for Arduino, and Apple's Core Bluetooth framework.

You will need to download RedBearLab's Bluetooth Library for Arduino and copy them to your Arduino's libraries directory. http://redbearlab.com/bleshield/

Upload the sketch to your Arduino, and the iOS project to your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.

You can see a video of it working here: http://youtu.be/43sXqTC9WlE

Have fun,

Dalmo
